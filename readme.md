# Foodhub Project

The Foodhub Project is a data analysis of food delivery services in the United States. It uses Jupyter Notebook and Python to analyze data related to food delivery services.

## Overview

The Foodhub Project aims to provide insights into the food delivery industry in the United States. The project analyzes data related to food delivery services, such as customer orders, delivery times, and restaurant ratings. By analyzing this data, the project may help businesses in the food delivery industry make informed decisions about their operations, marketing, and customer service.

The project uses Jupyter Notebook and Python, two popular tools for data analysis and visualization. The data is stored in a CSV file, which is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for analysis. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.
